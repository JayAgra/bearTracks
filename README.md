# Scouting Webapp

A webapp for FRC scouting...

## Backend

When setting up, place the backend files in the same folder as the html files. To use most of the features, you will need your own FRC API key. Get one <a href="https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/services/API">here</a>. Encode the key into Base64, and paste the key into the PHP files (match.php and query.php).
