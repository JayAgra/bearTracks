# Using PHP as backend

## Uploading and starting

Upload `submit.php` and `data.db` to your webserver. Rename `TEAMKEYHERE` on line 2 to whatever you would like the form password to be. If you do not want one, delete the entire if statement.

## Updating the frontend

You will need to host or distribute your own frontend. Take `index.html` and `main.css` and open them in an editor (you will not need to edit main.css). Change the form action (`line 10`) to point to where you hosted it, including the protocall (`http`, `https`).

## That's it!
